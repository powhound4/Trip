#Teamwork Questionnaire

1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else?  What hours?
I like to use Slack as a group chat. I can be reached between noon and 10pm, 7 days a week.

2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
I would like each member to contribute equally to each project. 

3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
Starting projects early and finishing a few days before the deadline to avoid all nighters on the day before the assignment due date. Communicating early with issues to keep making progress.

4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
Team members not responding to messages in a reasonable time. 

5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
The team members who want the "A" end up doing more work than the "B" members.

6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
Yes if it is necessary to pick up the slack of other members.

7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
I don't know what the project is so it's hard to say. Few hours a week.

8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
Meet as a group and break up the project into pieces. 

9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
It will screw over the group.

10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
Those who want higher quality work will spend more time fixing the lower quality work.

11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
Give deadlines for different pieces of code throughout each sprint.

12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Yes, we could meet after class.

13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
Once or twice a week

14. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
No

15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Continue to move forward without the last team members approval

16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
If everyone else is happy with following then nothing. Otherwise talk it out.

17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
Talk to members and then talk to instructor as needed.
