* Evan Salzman
* ESFP
* Teamwork Questionaire:
1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What hours?
   * Text is the best and the time doesn’t matter. I’ll answer quickly at any time during the day.
1. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
    * I’m expecting that our team will gain experience in making a product through the creation process, which is used in the industry.
1. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
    * I would like to see how completing coding projects works with a team, because all of the classes in CS up to this point have been focused on individual completion of assignments.
1. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
    * Such obstacles will likely relate to finding a time every week that works in everyone’s schedule that we can all work on the project together.
1. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
    * Some people will want to thoroughly check and re-check portions of the assignment, while the others will just hope that things are done correctly. Those who want an A will have to motivate those who are fine with a B to stay focused and assist the team in what it needs to get the A.
1. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
    * No, because it is not fair for some students to do more work, while others are not, and then everyone get the same grade.
1. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
    * I’m expecting to spend a minimum of 6-8 hours a week working on the project, but I also expect that the time will increase at times, especially later on in the semester.
1. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
    * We will have to decide as a group. I think that everyone in the group will need to understand what progress in being made in all parts of the project, even if it is not the part that person is primarily working on. There can be divided tasks, but all team members should understand all aspects of the project.
1. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
    * From my experience, when this happens, often another group member will have to fill in, because it has to get done somehow. I don’t think this is an acceptable situation, but I’m hoping that all group members will hold them all accountable for getting their portions of the assignment completed in a timely manner.
1. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
    * Some people may have different opinions on the quality, but it will be important and essential that the team agrees from the start on what the quality of the work completed will be.
1. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
    * As long as all team members are completing their work on time and thoroughly, I don’t think that different work habits will cause an issue. It will be important that each group member explains their work habits to the group at the beginning of the class.
1. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
    * Yes, I think that a consistent time will be important to have at least once a week.
1. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
    * I think that the team will need to meet at least once a week, perhaps at the same time every week and when necessary, at additional points when and where applicable.
1. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
    * It depends on the decision. Many decisions can be made just by the team member, but if it’s something major, such as updating master, I think that should be brought up with the full group before that is done. Minor decisions relating to a team member’s completion of a certain aspect of the assignment are likely safe for that person to make on their own.
1. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
    * In this case, it will be important to listen and understand the viewpoint of that one person, because it’s necessary to consider everyone's opinion. If there is a way to compromise between the two ideas, we will aim for that.
1. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
    * In this case, I’d need to bring up the matter with the person who seems to be dominating the team process. It’s possible that it isn’t their intention to control the process, but it may just be their work style.
1. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
    * I will express the uneven distribution of responsibilities to the group and suggest to the other team members to take on some of the responsibilities that I’ve been doing.
