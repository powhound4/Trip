Teamwork Questionnaire
1. You can reach me by text, from 8 am to 12 am.
2. I expect that we will build something amazing, that exceeds the assignment expectations.
3. I want to get better at communicating with my team members, especially when I’m feeling
frustrated. This isn’t going to work well if the expectations aren’t clear for all team members, so
if there is something that is important to me, or that is bothering me, I would like to get better
at communicating that.
4. If I am too afraid to speak up and let the other members know what I am feeling, nothing will
change and I will feel stressed out about the assignment. We need to communicate with each
other, set up a weekly schedule and set weekly goals in order to be successful. If we don’t do
those things, we will struggle to complete the work.
5. I think it is more reasonable for the team members who want a B to raise their expectations to
strive for an A, rather than those who want an A to lower their expectations and settle for a B.
Everyone will be happier with an A in the end. It may just take a little extra push from the team
members that want an A. I am hoping that I have picked other students who have the same
motivation level as I do.
6. It is not acceptable for other team members to do more work on the assignment, although I will
say from experience, it is almost never exactly equal. The hope is to get everyone on the same
page and assign tasks, work together and design something that we can all be really proud of.
7. I am not sure exactly how much time it will take but I am estimating 20 to 25 hours per week. It
all depends on what kind of issues we run in to along the way.
8. I think that delegating tasks as a group will work best. Although I do think that one person needs
to step in to a leadership role.
9. If someone doesn’t follow through with commitment they need to be confronted about it or it
will keep happening. This is where I hope to build my communication and confrontational skills
because school is too important to me to let someone else bring my grade down. I think there is
a certain way to say things without being mean, just being firm about the group expectations
and if things don’t change then our team will need to schedule a meeting with the professor.
10. Everyone’s voice needs to be heard and the expectations about the quality of the product need
to be decided beforehand. If we plan everything out and build it according to the plan we
designed together, this hopefully won’t be an issue.
11. Everyone has different ways of getting things done, as long as it gets done, I will try not to worry
about when or how they are working on their part. Have a little faith that they will do what they
say they will do.
12. I would like to have a standing meeting time outside of class.
13. I think the team will need to meet two or three times weekly.
14. It depends on what kind of decision. If it’s critical to the design of the project, then yes, but if it’s
not something that is critical, moving forward with the change is acceptable. That will be
something we will have to decide as a team. 
15. Majority rules, as long as each team member has had a change to voice their opinion and
everyone has carefully weighed out the options.
16. Considering our grades will be evaluated based on each team member’s individual participation,
this would be treated just like a team member wasn’t doing their fair share. Someone on the
team, or all team members would need to talk to this person about changing what they are
doing.
17. Facilitating doesn’t bother me so much, it’s doing most of the actual work that would bother
me. I think it will be important for someone on the team to take charge and facilitate the
process. As long as everyone is doing their share of the work, I don’t see this as being a huge
problem.
