1. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, email, vmail or something else? What hours?
  * Text 9am - 8pm
2. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
  * I expect that we will have assignments done days prior to the due date to allow us time to test/debug and perfect the project.
3. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
  * My personal goals for improving teamwork is to get my work done ASAP to allow my teammates to work on their tasks more effectively.
4. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
  * Obstacles I might encounter are issues with github and learning new syntax or languages if the assignment calls for something I haven't learned yet.
5. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
  * It depends on the time, if its down to the wire and we have a “B” Program I’d cut my losses and take the B, but if we have plenty of time to get it to an “A” I’d push for the “A”.
6. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
  * I think it is acceptable for a team member to put forth more effort to get an “A” even if that individual is me.
7. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
  * Its hard to say, as many hours as it will take until it is done. Hopefully no more than 9 hours a week.
8. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
  * Partners will be assigned tasks based on their strengths, interests and default on those who don't take initiative.
9. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
  * Contact that person to remind them, if it is habitual than the professor will be notified and that persons work will fall on the other group members to finish.
10. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
  * If someone is okay with low quality work than I would ask them to fix it or myself or someone else will make it higher quality.
11. How will you deal with different work habits of team members? 
  * To each their own, as long as the work gets done.
12. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
  * Only if the time works for all members and the time is used wisely.
13. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
  * At least once a week maybe more as the deadline approaches.
14. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
  * It depends on the decision I'm making, if it is a small task to complete for the project than no. However if it is a decision bearing a lot of weight, like turning in the project than yes.
15. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something? 
  * Ask that team member why they disagree.
16. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
  * As long as the team is producing results and working together smoothly, it shouldn't be an issue.
17. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
  * I would try to delegate if I felt overwhelmed, and talk to the professor if things don't change.
