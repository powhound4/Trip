# Sprint 5 - *T04* - *4TheWin*

## Goal

### Reliable first release with clean code!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v5.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and an executable JAR file for the demo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>5.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Planning Decisions Made Based on Velocity of Previous Sprints
* The purpose of this sprint for our team is to get caught up from the previous sprint. 
* We will be adding some functionality, but will focus on completing all Sprint 4 epics, cleaning up our code, adding tests and updating our user interface
* We will start earlier to allow time to review all aspects of our release and make sure that everything is complete and in perfect working order.
* We will plan times to meet as a group for collaboration and to work through any issues we are having.
* Time management for this sprint will be critical as we all have several other projects due around the same time
* Each team member will work through the backlog starting with the items at the top first, communicating to the team about what they are working on and when. This will reduce conflicts in the code.
